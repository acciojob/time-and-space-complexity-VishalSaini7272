<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
<p>Time complexity is an efficient way to measure how the runtime of an algorithm changes with input size. An efficient algorithm will have a lower time complexity.</p>
<p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm, and in some cases, it can be described as having Space Complexity O(n).</p>
